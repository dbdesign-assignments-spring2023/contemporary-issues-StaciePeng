# World Bank Data Rigging Scandal of Improving China's Ranking in Doing Business Index
In this document, I discuss two articles about World Bank's data scandal in manipulating the data in "Doing Business" report. The World Bank's "Doing Business Index" was accused to improve China's ranking. I present and discuss two articles about this topic with opposing views.
## Article 1
In Reuters' [Analysis: World Bank, IMF face long-term damage after data rigging scandal](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-bank-imf-face-long-term-damage-after-data-rigging-scandal-2021-10-04/), there's clear evidence that the World Bank's manipulation of data is a serious breach of trust and undermines the integrity of the "Doing Business" index. 

I believe that the World Bank boosted China's ranking since the bank was seeking Beijing's support for a major capital increase. China held some financial power over the World Bank, which is about raising money through a campaign for a capital increase and fundraising for its concessional finance program. A higher position in the World Bank's "Doing Business" index can result in an increase in foreign investment, leading to growth in a country's economy and financial markets. Ranking system is the clearest way for politicians and public to use, so the importance of the index is very significant. 

More, in Reuter's interview with Shanta Devarajan, the former World Bank official in charge of the Doing Business report in 2017. He saids that changes were made in the database without his consultation, so there would be corruption in the manipulation. The World Bank's data manipulation call into question the validity of the index and cast doubt on the organization's ability to accurately measure and report on the ease of doing business in different countries.

## Article 2
On the other side, in the article[IMF's Georgieva accuses former World Bank President Kim's office of manipulation](https://www.reuters.com/business/imfs-georgieva-accuses-former-world-bank-president-kims-office-manipulation-2021-09-24/) stated that the World Bank is not altering data for the Doing Business Index for seeking support of capital increase. However, the chief has blocked a proposal of adding Hong Kong data in the index for equality of the rank.

In order to accurately reflect the country's business environment and ranking, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva intervened to block adding Hong Kong's data towards China's ranking. This shows her conern of maintaining the trustworthiness of World Bank data. Hence, the World Bank's data was accurate.

However, I think intervention of adding data of a city to the country is actually a kind of data alteration. She states that dropping Hong Kong's data was to lower the rank of China for equality of the index, but there is still data manipulation for the rank. 

In conclusion, there is issue of data manipulation in the World Bank towards the "Doing Business Index" and data manipulation is a serious issue which raises questions about the validity and integrity of the "Doing Business" index.
